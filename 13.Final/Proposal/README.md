# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

WEB BASED SYNTHESIS/SAMPLING

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

I would like to create an analogue style polyphonic synthesizer in RNBO and implement it online in a way that goes far beyond the RNBO template. I want it to have powerful sampling capability too and FX processing for both so it can do a lot of unexpected stuff.

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Hardcore stereo panning for each oscillator, generative synthesis is directly accessible, lots of sampling and FX processing capability so it can also function as a sampler, maybe even IOS compatibility. I've already created basic RNBO exports to the web template this class has just given me the tools to break out of the web template I think. Overall, it should be a very unique approach to synthesis and sampling

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

I have been learning a lot about creating synths with Matthew Davidson's instrument building course. I think its a perfect time to use what I've learned from him but I would have to start from scratch too because of how different RNBO structure is than normal max msp.

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?

A web based synthesizer and sampler that makes sound. It will definitely not look exactly like the RNBO tempelate and it will be quirky even if it lacks power.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can really start pushing bounderies. I've been learning so much from matthew and I think I have the creativity and enough basic CS skills to create something refreshing and powerful. I hope it can be powerful and unique

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A fresh take on the idea of modern syntesis blurring the lines between analogue synthesis, generative synthesis and drum synthesis. An inspiring approach to creating digital music that may lack overall power but helps the user create sound they wouldn't have expected all while using an IOS device connected to a website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I just need to get better at understanding and editing the web templates RNBO exports. I also need to understand how to do polyphony most efficiently since RNBO doesnt support MC cables. I think I have the basic tools required to do this mentally already though which makes it so exciting :)
