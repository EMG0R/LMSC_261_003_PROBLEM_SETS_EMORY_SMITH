# Web-based RNBO Synth Guide:

- make sure cutoff type is 1 for lowpass, cutoff frequency is appropriate and ADSR paramaters are set to appropriate values so you can hear the synth
- cutoff type moves between lowpass, highpass, bandpass and notch
- notes are represented by buttons according to their midi CC       
- there are 3 oscillators to chose between with their own volume and waveform selection for tone control 
- have fun synthesizing
