## Description

The final project is an opportunity to take your newly acquired programming skills to develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon the course materials, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. However, remember that your project needs to be approved by the instructor. Your project may be graphical, audio, web-based, text-based, or file-based. It may be a game, a math or science application, a sports statistics package, or a productivity application (such as a "lite" version of Word or Excel). The LMSC-261 final project is wide-open, and you are expected to be creative in your approach to it.

You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the instructor approves. You can utilize any infrastructure, provided you can access the hardware and software your project requires. Build something that interests you and something that outlives this course.

## Starter Ideas
Here are just some of the ideas for your final project:

- A web-based application using HTML, JavaScript, Python, and SQL.
- An iOS app using [Swift](https://swift.org/).
- An interactive audiovisual program using [Processing](https://processing.org/).
- A 2D game using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) or Lua with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).
- A synthesizer on the web browser using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).
- A Python-based synthesizer using [PYO](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/).
- An Android app using [Java](https://www.java.com/en/).
- A Chrome extension using JavaScript.
- A command-line program using Python.
- A hardware-based application for which you program some device, such as [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

## Schedule

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted except in cases of emergency.

### Proposal

*LMSC-261-001: due by November 28, 09:00 EST*
*LMSC-261-002: due by November 28, 14:00 EST*

The proposal is your opportunity to receive approval and counsel from your instructor before you proceed to design. Your instructor will either approve your proposal or require modifications for subsequent approval. Even if approved, your proposal is not binding; you may alter your plan at any point, provided you obtain your instructor's consent for any modifications. You must resubmit your proposal if you made changes to your final project. 

<p style="font-size: 16px; color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Projects submitted without approval will not receive credit. Communicate with the instructor if you plan to change your project.</p>

Create a new folder named `FinalProject` in your GitHub repository for problem sets. In the `FinalProject` folder in your GitHub repository, create another folder called `Proposal`. Inside the `Proposal`, make a `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Proposal/README.md](./Proposal/README.md). Commit and push your proposal before the deadline.

### Status Report

*LMSC-261-001: due by December 5, 09:00 EST*
*LMSC-261-002: due by December 5, 14:00 EST*

Not only is the status report intended to keep the instructor apprised of your progress, but it is also an opportunity to keep yourself on track. 

<p style="font-size: 16px; color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You cannot change your project after the status report due date/time.</p>

In the `FinalProject` folder in your GitHub repository, create another folder named `StatusReport`. Inside the `StatusReport `, make a `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Status/README.md](./Status/README.md). Commit and push your status report before the deadline.

### Final Implementation

*LMSC-261-001: due by December 12, 09:00 EST*
*LMSC-261-002: due by December 12, 14:00 EST*

<p style="font-size: 16px; color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> No late submission is accepted, except in cases of emergency.</p>

You must submit your software implementation and documentation of your final project via GitHub in the `FinalProject` folder. Your submission thereof must include all of the following:

1. Documentation for your project in `README.md` (You must name this file `README.md`). This documentation is to be a user's manual for your project. Though your documentation structure is entirely up to you, it should be evident to the instructor how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least **several paragraphs** in length. The instructor should not need to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hands with this documentation; be sure to answer any questions that you think someone might have while testing your work in your documentation.

2. A "design document" for your project in the form of a Markdown file called `DESIGN.md` that technically discusses how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least **several paragraphs** in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user's manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the instructor a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.

3. All files required to run your software, including source code and, if applicable, configuration files, sample inputs, SQLite databases, etc. You should thoroughly comment on all source codes.

4. A presentation file in PowerPoint (.ppt) or Keynote (.key). Your presentation file should have the following name convention: `LMSC-261-your-name`. You should have your name, project title, and details you want to convey to your classmates in your presentation. A Keynote file named [PresentationGuideline.key](./PresentationGuideline/PresentationGuideline.key) is included as a guideline for preparing your presentation.

As the fourth point suggests, you will be presenting your final project during the last week of the semester. You will be required to demo your software during your 10-minute presentation. Suppose you fear the live demo will not work during your presentation. In that case, you may consider videotaping your software before the last week of the semester and include it in your presentation. Please **bring your laptop** to present your final project.

Please note that your final project submission will only be accepted through GitHub. The instructor will not accept other forms of submission. Please consult the instructor if you have issues submitting your final project via GitHub *before* the due date.

## Academic Honesty
You will be expected to credit the originator of any ideas, words, programming code, or other ideas you incorporate into your work. In computer programming, it's common to use program components written by others known to be reliable. Many program codes are freely available online. One must always give full attribution to the original author of all program codes.
