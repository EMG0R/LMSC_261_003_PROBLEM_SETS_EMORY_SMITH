WEB BASED SYNTHESIS WITH RNBO

***

Short answers (at least 3 sentences) for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to rewrite your proposal and email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

First I created a basic RNBO patch for prophet 6 type polyphonic synthesis. Then I got the export to run through a vscode server using the RNBO template. Most recently I've been messing with the .css file to make the page feel how I want it to.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to converted my usual generative oscillator structure from normal max to RNBO. There are so many useful objects from max are missing in RNBO it is causing me great suffering. I also have yet to bring anything truly innovative over from my current max synth which is the whole interesting part of this for me. I would also like to host it on a rasberry pi at home or something so I could access it from any computer for the final project

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I can't split the control faders apart for some reason. I can create new buttons and edit everything about the page except the way the control faders are formatted and send data because they are all called at the same time from a different file in the template. That's the last step until this is a fully customized web-based synth. Now I just need to make it interesting.
